Summary:
 Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer that occurs in adolescents in the 
age of 10 to 14 years. The dataset is composed of Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained 
osteosarcoma histology images. 

 The data was collected by a team of clinical scientists at University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center, Dallas. 
 Archival samples for 50 patients treated at Children’s Medical Center, Dallas, between 1995 
and 2015, were used to create this dataset. 
Four patients (out of 50) were selected by pathologists based on diversity of tumor specimens 
after surgical resection. The images are labelled as Non-Tumor, Viable Tumor and Necrosis 
according to the predominant cancer type in each image. The annotation was performed by two 
medical experts. 
 All images were divided between two pathologists for the annotation activity. Each image had
a single annotation as any given image was annotated by only one pathologist. The dataset 
consists of 1144 images of size 1024 X 1024 at 10X resolution with the following distribution: 
 536 (47%) non-tumor images, 263 (23%) necrotic tumor images and 345 (30%) viable tumor tiles.
